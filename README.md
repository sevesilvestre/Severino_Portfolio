# [Project 1: New York AirBNB Data Science Project: Project Overview](https://github.com/sevesilvestre/NYC_AirBNB_Data)
• Cleaned and managed a complex dataset of 50,000 data points and 16 variables to gather relevant and insightful data in Python

• Developed nine different models utiliizing cross validation, dimensionality reduction, and K-Modes/K-Prototype clustering to determine which variables affected NYC AirBNB prices while providing business insight on the NYC AirBNB environment

• Concluded that NYC AirBNB’s are influenced most by location and room type where “Entire Home” AirBNB’s in Manhattan increased the price of an AirBNB the most

# [Project 2: Heart Stroke Prediction Data Science Project: Project Overview](https://github.com/sevesilvestre/StrokePredictionData)
• Produced a logistic regression and decision tree model with an 85% accuracy rate that predicted whether a patient was going to experience a stroke based on multiple variables

• Conducted K-Means clustering models with an NbClust function to determine the optimal number of distinct groups within the data set

• Determined that age, BMI, average glucose levels, and history of hypertension were the most influential variables when predicting a stroke

# [Project 3: Business Analytical Plan for Rosetta Stone: Project Overview](https://github.com/sevesilvestre/BusinessAnalysisRosettaStone)
• Developed a linear regression model and point-based rating system to identify Rosetta stone subscriber segments.

• Translated performance metrics and analysis into strategic business recommendations focused on increasing profitability and identifying growth opportunities.

• Built a compelling insight-driven narrative and designed concise data visualizations to communicate our findings effectively and reduce complexity.

# [Project 4: India Flight Visualization Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/sevesilvestre/IndiaFlightAnalysis)
• Purpose: Analyze domestic flights in India over the span of 50 days to determine how the top performing airlines are positioning their business through pricing strategies based on factors such as departure time, arrival time, class, flight duration, and days before flight.
