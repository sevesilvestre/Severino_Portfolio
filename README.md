# [Project 1: New York AirBNB Data Science Project: Project Overview](https://github.com/sevesilvestre/NYC_AirBNB_Data)
• Cleaned and managed a complex dataset of 50,000 data points and 16 variables to gather relevant and insightful data in Python

• Developed nine different models utiliizing cross validation, dimensionality reduction, and K-Modes/K-Prototype clustering to determine which variables affected NYC AirBNB prices while providing business insight on the NYC AirBNB environment

• Concluded that NYC AirBNB’s are influenced most by location and room type where “Entire Home” AirBNB’s in Manhattan increased the price of an AirBNB the most

# [Project 2: Heart Stroke Prediction Data Science Project: Project Overview](https://github.com/sevesilvestre/StrokePredictionData)
• Produced a logistic regression and decision tree model with an 85% accuracy rate that predicted whether a patient was going to experience a stroke based on multiple variables

• Conducted K-Means clustering models with an NbClust function to determine the optimal number of distinct groups within the data set

• Determined that age, BMI, average glucose levels, and history of hypertension were the most influential variables when predicting a stroke
