# Project 1: New York AirBNB Data Science Project: Project Overview
• Cleaned and managed a complex dataset of 50,000 data points and 16 variables to gather relevant and insightful data in Python

• Developed nine different models utiliizing cross validation, dimensionality reduction, and K-Modes/K-Prototype clustering to determine which variables affected NYC AirBNB prices while providing business insight on the NYC AirBNB environment

• Concluded that NYC AirBNB’s are influenced most by location and room type where “Entire Home” AirBNB’s in Manhattan increased the price of an AirBNB the most
